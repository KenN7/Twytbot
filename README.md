Python auto-replying twitter bot
-------
Works with python2 and 3
Simple bot used to answer to a tweet when detecting results on certain patterns on twitter searches.
Just use the "perceval.py" example to understand how it works.

This bot depends on Twython lib, therefore it must be installed.

Thanks to Daniel for his [php Nappa bot](http://dan.cx/2011/06/twitter-autoreply-bot-dbznappa). This one is basically a rework in python of his bot, with better multiple patterns handling.
