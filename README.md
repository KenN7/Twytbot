Python auto-replying twitter bot
-------

Simple bot used to answer to a tweet when detecting results on certain patterns of twitter.
Just use the "perceval.py" example to understand how it works.

You must have Twython installed in order for it to work

Thanks to Daniel for his [php Nappa bot](http://dan.cx/2011/06/twitter-autoreply-bot-dbznappa). This one is basically a rework in python of his bot, with better multiple patterns handling.
